    # The default behavior for a target is to have one of its spec field default to the source resource output.
    #
    # More specifically for a resource of kind "shell", updatecli would append the value after the command such as
    # `npm install --package-lock-only --dry-run=$DRY_RUN axios@ 1.0.0`
    # Please note the space between axios@ and 1.0.0
    #
    # In this context, it doesn't work as the npm command requires axios@1.0.0 to be attached without a space
    #
    # Therefore we disable the default source output by using the parameter "disablesourceinput: true"
    # And then we use the Updatecli specific templating function {{ source "<sourceID>" }}
    disablesourceinput: true

    # scmid binds a target with a scm configuration.
    # Updatecli clones the git repository in a temporary location, then updates it
    # according to the current declarative pipeline.
    scmid: default

    # Spec contains the specific parameter for a specific kind of resource which in this case, is the resource "shell"
    spec:

      # The environment DRY_RUN is set and used by Updatecli to identify if:
      #   1. we are in dry-run mode by running `updatecli diff --config manifest.yaml`
      #   2. We are in apply mode by running `updatecli apply --config manifest.yaml`
      command: npm install --package-lock-only --dry-run=$DRY_RUN axios@{{ source "npm" }}

      # By default, shell command only have access to the DRY_RUN environment variable.
      # But in this situation, we would also need the PATH value to identify where the npm command is
      #
      # As the PATH environment value is not defined, then it inherits the value from the Updatecli process.
      environments:
        - name: PATH

      # changedif defines how Updatecli should interpreted a failure or a change
      # in this case we use the changedif of kind "file/checksum".
      # A filechecksum change would report a change.
      changedif:
        kind: file/checksum
        spec:
          files:

      # npm expects to run the command from the directory containing the package.json
      # workdir allows to specify the path where to run the command.
      # If the resource has a scmid, then the workdir relative path is from the scm directory cloned
      # in the temporary directory such as /tmp/updatecli on POSIX system.
      workdir: "assets/code_example/docs/guides/npm/"

# scms defines the git repository configuration which can then be used by the target and the action
# Updatecli will clone that repository in the OS temporary location such as /tmp on Darwin or Linux system.

    spec:
      owner: updatecli

      token: '{{ requiredEnv "GITHUB_TOKEN" }}'
      username: '{{ requiredEnv "GITHUB_ACTOR" }}'
      branch: master

# actions, are actions to execute if the state of a binded target is changed.
# such as opening a pullrequest.
#
actions:
  default:
    # The github/pullrequest means Updatecli will create a temporary branch containing all the changes
    # generated by the different target using the same scmid.
    #
    # Then If needed, it opens a pullrequest targeting the scm branch referenced by scmid
