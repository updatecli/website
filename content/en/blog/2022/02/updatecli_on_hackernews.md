Last week, I had the chance to see Updatecli featured on both [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30286047) and the Devops'ish mailing list.
It means a lot to me because they are both a source of information that I read regularly.
Thank you very much for all your support. I received a lot of valuable feedback which I need to process now.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss the project and see how it can help you.

Thank you for your support
