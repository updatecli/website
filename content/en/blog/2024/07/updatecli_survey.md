Getting feedback on an OSS project is hard. Most of the time, we can only rely on people reporting issues, which tell us little about what we are doing right or what we should focus on.

To better understand your experience with the Updatecli project, we'd love for you to participate in our Updatecli [survey](https://forms.gle/dV6LmSh2XGDF5Zzg7):

The survey is anonymous and all questions are optional.

Thanks in advance for your help.
