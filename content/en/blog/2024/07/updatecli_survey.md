Getting feedback on OSS project is hard. Most of the time we can rely only on people reporting issues that tell us little about the things we do right or things we should focus on.

To better understand your experience with the  Updatecli project, we'd love you to participate in our Updatecli [survey](https://forms.gle/dV6LmSh2XGDF5Zzg7):

The survey is anonymous and all questions are optional.

Thanks in advance for your help.
