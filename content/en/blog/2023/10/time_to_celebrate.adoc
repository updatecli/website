= Time to celebrate!

Time flies when we work on things we love, which makes it easy to miss successful milestones.

Working on Updatecli for my projects has been a time saver and ultimately a real joy.
I can watch my git repositories getting updated automatically with a few tweaks here and there.

It feels even better knowing that I also contribute indirectly to many small and large projects in the world.

Through this journey, I received great feedbacks which kept motivating me to continue further.

Those feedbacks take many different forms such as: getting direct messages, watching the project **link:https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md[Adopters]** file growing, reviewing contribution, and also financial support.

== Financial Support

When it comes to companies financially sponsoring my work, my first ever sponsor came from **link:https://prefect.io/[Prefect]** who keeps sponsoring me month after month but also helped me make Updatecli more robust by providing invaluable feedback.

Another major support comes from **link:https://github.com/ForesightMiningSoftwareCorporation[Foresight Mining]**, who not only sponsors financially but also contributes code like Rust support.

I really love seeing those two company names sponsoring me as they are evolving in totally different domains, and not even from the continent where I live.

Ok, I see you coming, they are both software companies, but nowadays what company is not a software company that needs to maintain Git repositories?

=== Prefect

Prefect is the company behind the successful OSS project of the same name **link:https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect[Prefect]**. Prefect is a workflow orchestration tool that empowers developers to build, observe, and react to data pipelines.

=== Foresight Mining

Foresight Mining is currently busy building the next generation of IOT collaborative CAD systems.

== So what's coming next?

As always it's hard to tell, but I guess finding the right balance between implementing crazy ideas, having fun, and fixing bugs we encounter as Updatecli usage grows.

With a more concrete example, the biggest recent addition to Updatecli is the Terraform support contributed by **link:https://warman.io/[Matthew Warman]** where using the declarative approach combining plugins **link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/plugins/resource/terraform/file/[terraform/file]**, **link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/plugins/resource/terraform/lock/[terraform/lock]**, **link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/plugins/resource/terraform/provider/[terraform/provider]**, or **link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/plugins/resource/terraform/registry/[terraform/registry]** (or any others existing plugins), we can define tailored update pipeline for Terraform related project, or OpenTofu.

In version 0.62.0, Matthew also contributed the **link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/plugins/autodiscovery/terraform/[Terraform Autodiscovery plugin]** allowing to automatically handle Terraform project updates.
For example, we can run commands such as `updatecli diff --experimental` to see what would change in Terraform project containing a Terraform lock file.

On my side, I am exploring the possibility of using OCI registries such as DockerHub or ghcr.io to share and reuse Updatecli policies.
As the project evolves, we face more and more the need to run Updatecli at scale. And being able to easily share and reuse existing Update policies would be another milestone.

== Let's Connect

As usual, if you have any questions feel free to reach out via our **link:https://matrix.to/#/#Updatecli_community:gitter.im[chat]**

And do not forget to star our project on GitHub repository **link:https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/stargazers[updatecli/updatecli]** as it's probably one of the easiest ways to show your appreciation.

== The People ❤️

The Updatecli wouldn't stand here today without all the people who contributed to it.
Thank you very much for being around.
