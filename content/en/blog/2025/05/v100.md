We just released Updatecli version **[v0.100.0](https://www.updatecli.io/changelogs/updatecli/changelogs/v0.100.0/)**!
While hitting version 100 feels like a milestone, the truth is even more impressive: we've published **206 releases** since the beginning of the project, 5 years ago.

Very early on, we automated the release process using **GitHub Actions**, **GoReleaser**, and of course, **Updatecli** itself.
This setup allows us to publish all artifacts from various Git repositories with just a few clicks—right from GitHub. It also means that other core contributors can trigger releases even when I'm not available, helping the project stay agile.

This level of automation allows us to move quickly. I usually try to merge community PRs promptly and aim to publish a new release within the same week.

Stability remains a top priority—when something goes wrong, we revert the problematic PR and cut a new release. It has happened a few times, but thankfully, we've always been able to identify and fix the issues quickly.

## The Challenge of Frequent Releases

However, frequent releases also come with a challenge: **communication**.
With so many updates, it's easy for changes to get lost. Sometimes, users ask for features that have already been implemented—they just weren't aware.

To address this, about a year ago we started an experiment: **automatically publishing release notes to the Updatecli website**:

📄 [Changelogs on updatecli.io](https://www.updatecli.io/changelogs/updatecli/)

The goal was to improve the visibility of each release. While I don't yet have a reliable way to measure its effectiveness, I do see some traffic in the updatecli.io website analytics, so it seems to be helping.

If you're curious about how we generate those release notes, check out this post:

## What’s Next

Looking ahead, I believe we can do a better job of summarizing the overall evolution of the project—something more digestible for users who don’t follow every release.

If you have feedback or ideas on how we can improve, I'd love to hear them!

## What about v0.100.0

### 🛠️ GitLab Merge Request Enhancements  

You can now configure additional fields—such as labels, assignees, and more—when creating merge requests via GitLab using Updatecli.  
Thanks to [@alikhil](https://github.com/alikhil) for this contribution!  
👉 Makes Updatecli more flexible for GitLab-based CI/CD workflows.

### 📦 Cargo Autodiscovery Improvement  

Updatecli's Cargo autodiscovery now uses `cargo-upgrade` instead of `cargo update` to handle Rust dependency updates.  
Thanks to [@loispostula](https://github.com/loispostula)!  
👉 Preserves formatting of `Cargo.toml` files and improves semver handling.
