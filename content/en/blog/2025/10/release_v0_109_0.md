Otherwise, read on for the highlights of this release!

## ðŸš€ Highlights

### 1. GitHub App Support for GitHub Authentication

**Updatecli now supports GitHub App authentication!**
This is a important feature for teams and organizations that need secure, scalable, and high-rate-limit access to the GitHub API.

#### Why is this important?

- **Higher API rate limits** compared to personal access tokens (PATs)
- **Granular permissions** for improved security
- **Centralized management** for CI/CD and automation workflows

#### How to use GitHub App authentication

You can configure Updatecli to use a GitHub App either via environment variables or directly in your manifest. Hereâ€™s how:

**Via Environment Variables:**

```sh
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID="123456"
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat /path/to/private-key.pem)"
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID="789012"
```

Or, using a private key file:

```sh
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID="123456"
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="/path/to/private-key.pem"
export UPDATECLI_GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID="789012"
```

**Via Manifest:**

```yaml
scms:
  default:
    kind: github
    spec:
      owner: myorg
      repository: myrepo
      app:
        clientID: "123456"
        privateKey: "{{ requiredEnv `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` }}"
        installationID: "789012"
```

Or with a private key path:

```yaml
scms:
  default:
    kind: github
    spec:
      owner: myorg
      repository: myrepo
      app:
        clientID: "123456"
        privateKeyPath: "/path/to/private-key.pem"
        installationID: "789012"
```

Important: Environment variables override manifest configuration !

> **Tip:** For best security and maintainability, prefer using a GitHub App or environment variables for authentication, and avoid hardcoding secrets in your manifests.

### 2. NPM Autodiscovery: Ignore Version Constraints

**New!** You can now configure NPM autodiscovery to **ignore version constraints** in your `package.json` files.
This means Updatecli can suggest updates even for dependencies with complex or restrictive constraints, giving you more flexibility in keeping your projects up to date.

**Example configuration:**

```yaml
autodiscovery:
  crawlers:
    npm:
      ignoreversionconstraints: true
```

- **Why use this?**
  - Easily surface updates for all dependencies, regardless of how constraints are defined.
  - Useful for bulk upgrades, security patching, or when constraints are too restrictive.

---

### 3. Cargo Autodiscovery: Build-Dependencies Support

Rust developers rejoice!
Updatecliâ€™s Cargo autodiscovery now supports **build-dependencies**, making it easier to keep your Rust projects and their build tooling up to date.

- Automatically detects and proposes updates for `[build-dependencies]` in your `Cargo.toml`.
- Works alongside regular dependencies for comprehensive coverage.

---

## ðŸ§° Other Notable Improvements

- **Slim Docker Image:**
  A new lightweight Docker image for Updatecli is now available, perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Better Rate Limit Handling:**
  Updatecli will now pause and resume automatically when hitting GitHub API rate limits, ensuring reliable automation.
- **Dependency Updates:**
  Numerous Go module bumps and toolchain upgrades for improved stability and security.
- **Adopters Update:**
  Welcome SUSE Rancher and RKE2 to the list of Updatecli adopters!
