It's time to close another great year on the Updatecli journey.

This year we achieved 29 releases contributed by over 20 community members.

It wouldn't be possible to list all the improvements in this post, so feel free to take a look to our website for a detailed list of changes on [**updatecli.io**](https://www.updatecli.io/changelogs/updatecli/)

And not only did we continue consolidating and improving Updatecli, we also experimented with new ideas.

For example, defining update strategies in YAML is convenient, saves time, and helps teams collaborate. But when update rules grow complex, a small DSL can become limiting. This year we explored using WASM to let teams write manifest generators in the language they prefer. The feature is still experimental, and we welcome feedback from teams with complex update scenarios.

This year was also special for conferences and community events. A heartfelt thank-you to Giovanni Toraldo and Anthony Benguerfi for presenting and sharing their experiences, it was inspiring to watch.

We presented talks at FOSDEM, Open Source Experience, and Incontro DevOps (in English, Italian, and French).

## Next Year

What’s coming in 2026? While we can't predict everything, we already plan to be at [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/2026/) and [**Configuration Management Camp**](https://cfgmgmtcamp.org/), so please come say hi if you're attending.

Our goals for 2026 include:

- Continue maturing plugin extensibility.
- Improve discovery and scaffolding for common project types.
- Increasing our sponsors to help us fund development and community activities.

We'd love more community blog posts and talks, if you'd like help preparing a talk or post, reach out. Thanks to ours sponsors, we can provide swag for contributors and speakers.

See you in 2026!
