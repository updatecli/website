== Description

An Updatecli action defines what happens after a change is detected and validated. While Updatecli's sources find changes (like a new version), and targets define where to apply them (like a file), actions describe what to do nextâ€”such as creating a pull request.

== Parameters

{{< coreparameters "actions" >}}

== Examples

In the follow example, we define an action that creates a pull request on GitHub when Updatecli detected outdated version of golangci-lint in GitHub action workflow files. The action uses the `github/pullrequest` plugin to create a pull request with a specific labels, merge method, automerge set to true.
