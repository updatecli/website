== Description

Depending on the situation a specific SCM block can be provided to manipulate information from a Github SCM repository by either fetching files from a repository or pushing files to them

**condition**

When the SCM block is used in a condition, it usually means fetching a file from that repository.

**target**

When the SCM block is used in a target, it usually means pushing a file to that repository.

It's important to notice that the Github SCM implements the Github workflow and therefore will push changes to a temporary branch then open a pull request targeting the branch defined in the configuration.

=== CommitMessage

Updatecli uses conventional commits as describe on link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/[www.conventionnalcommits.org]. +
The goal is to add human and machine readable meaning to commit messages

By default, Updatecli generates a commit message using the default type "chore" and split long title message into the body like:

---
```
