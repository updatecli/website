`versionFilter` allows to specify the kind of version retrieved from a resource and its version pattern.
Default value is "latest" as we want to retrieve the newest version from a resource.

==== latest

If kind is set to `latest` then no need to specify the patter as we gonna retrieve the newest version from the resource.

===== Example

```
sources:
  kubectl:
    kind: githubRelease
    spec:
      owner: "kubernetes"
      repository: "kubectl"
      token: "{{ requiredEnv .github.token }}"
      username: "john"
      versionFilter:
        kind: latest
    transformers:
      - trimPrefix: "kubernetes-"
```
Return the latest Github release and remove "kubernetes-" from it.

==== Lex

If the kind is set to `lex` then Updatecli returns the latest version sorted lexicographically.

Sorting versions lexicographically means arranging them based on their lexicographic order, which is essentially alphabetical order as used in dictionaries, but applied to version strings.

For example, in lexicographic order:

    "1.10" comes before "1.2", because it compares character by character:
        Compare "1" vs. "1" → equal.
        Compare "." vs "." → equal.
        Compare "1" vs. "2" → "1" is smaller, so "1.10" < "1.2".

This ordering does not account for numerical values of version components. For meaningful version comparisons, semantic versioning is typically preferred, where "1.2" < "1.10" because "2" is numerically smaller than "10".

===== Example

```yaml
sources:
  ubuntu-focal:
    name: Get latest ubuntu focal docker image tag using regex/time versionfilter
    kind: dockerimage
    spec:
      image: ubuntu
      versionfilter:
        kind: lex
```

==== regex

If `versionFilter.kind` is set to `regex` then we can use `versionFilter.pattern` to specify a regular expression to
return the newest version returned from a resource matching the regex
If no versionFilter.pattern is provided then it uses '.*' which return the newest version

```
sources:
  kubectl:
    kind: githubRelease
    spec:
      owner: "kubernetes"
      repository: "kubectl"
      token: "{{ requiredEnv .github.token }}"
      username: "john"
      versionFilter:
        kind: regex
        pattern: "kubernetes-1.(\\d*).(\\d*)$"
    transformers:
      - trimPrefix: "kubernetes-"
```
=> Return the newest kubectl version matching pattern "kubernetes-1.(\\d*).(\\d*)$" and remove "kubernetes-" from it

==== semver

If `versionFilter.kind` is set to `semver` then we can use `versionFilter.pattern` to specify version pattern as explained link:https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#checking-version-constraints[here]. In the process we also sort.
If no `versionFilter.pattern` is provided then it fallback to '*' which return the newest version.
If a version doesn't respect semantic versioning, then it's not the value is just ignored.

**Remark**

In the process we drop any characters not respecting semantic version like in this version "v1.0.0", we drop the "v" but we can added it back using `transformers`.

===== Example

```
  jenkins-wiki-exporter:
    kind: githubRelease
    spec:
      owner: "jenkins-infra"
      repository: "jenkins-wiki-exporter"
      token: "{{ requiredEnv .github.token }}"
      username: "john"
      versionFilter:
        kind: semver
        pattern: "~1.10"
```
=> Return the version "v1.10.3"

==== regex/semver

If `versionFilter.kind` is set to `regex/semver` then we can use `versionFilter.regex` to specify a regular expression to extract version numbers.
The regular expression should return the semantic version in the first capturing group.
We can then use `versionFilter.pattern` to specify version pattern as explained link:https://github.com/Masterminds/semver#checking-version-constraints[here]. In the process we also sort.
If no `versionFilter.pattern` is provided then it fallback to '*' which return the newest version.
If a extracted version doesn't respect semantic versioning, then it's not the value is just ignored.

===== Example

```
sources:
  default:
    name: Get latest version
    kind: githubrelease
    spec:
      owner: yarnpkg
      repository: berry
      token: '{{ requiredEnv "GITHUB_TOKEN" }}'
      versionfilter:
        kind: regex/semver
        regex: "@yarnpkg/cli/(\\d*\\.\\d*\\.\\d*)"
```
=> Return the version "4.5.3"

==== regex/time

If `versionFilter.kind` is set to `regex/time` then we can use `versionFilter.regex` to specify a regular expression to extract dates.
The regular expression should return the date in the first capturing group.
We can then use `versionFilter.pattern` to specify date pattern as explained link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format[here]. In the process we also sort.
If no `versionFilter.pattern` is provided then it fallback to '2006-01-02' which return the newest version using date format YYYY-MM-DD.
If a extracted date doesn't match the date pattern, then it's not the value is just ignored.

To define your own format/pattern, write down what the reference time would look like formatted your way; The model is to demonstrate what the reference time looks like so that the Format and Parse methods can apply the same transformation to a general time value.

Here is a summary of the components of a layout string. Each element shows by example the formatting of an element of the reference time. Only these values are recognized. Text in the layout string that is not recognized as part of the reference time is echoed verbatim during Format and expected to appear verbatim in the input to Parse. 

```
Year: "2006" "06"
Month: "Jan" "January" "01" "1"
Day of the week: "Mon" "Monday"
Day of the month: "2" "_2" "02"
Day of the year: "__2" "002"
Hour: "15" "3" "03" (PM or AM)
Minute: "4" "04"
Second: "5" "05"
AM/PM mark: "PM"
```

| Pattern | Example
| 2006-01-02 | 2021-01-02 (YYYY-MM-DD)
| 20060102 | 20210102 (YYYYMMDD)
| 20060201 | 20260201 (YYYYDDMM)

    kind: dockerimage
    spec:
      image: ubuntu
      versionfilter:
        kind: 'regex/time'
        regex: '^focal-(\d*)$'
        pattern: "20060102"
```

==== time

If `versionFilter.kind` is set to `time` then we can use `versionFilter.pattern` to specify date pattern as explained link:https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format[here]. In the process we also sort.
If no `versionFilter.pattern` is provided then it fallback to '2006-01-02' which return the newest version using date format YYYY-MM-DD.
Please note date time not matching the pattern will be ignored.
