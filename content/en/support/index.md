Welcome to the support page. Whether you're using the project, contributing to it, or just exploring, this page outlines how to get help, report issues, and engage with the community.

## Before You Ask

Before opening a ticket or asking a question:

- Review the [Documentation](/docs/prologue/introduction/)
- Browse the [FAQ](/docs/help/faq/) or common issues
- Search existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/issues) to see if your question has already been answered

## Getting Help

You can get help in the following ways:

### Community Channels

- **Discussions Forum**: Ask questions or start discussions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/discussions)
- **Chat**: Join the community on [Matrix](https://gitter.im/Updatecli/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

Please be respectful and follow our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

## Reporting Bugs

To report a bug:

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/issues)
2. If not found, open a new issue and include:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected and actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, version)
   - Relevant logs or screenshots

Well-written reports help us fix issues more efficiently.

## Requesting Features

To suggest a new feature:

- Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/your-org/your-project/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
- Describe the feature, its purpose, and why it is useful
- Optionally, suggest implementation ideas

## Supporting the Community

You can support the project in several ways:

- Answer questions on the GitHub discussion or chat
- Improve the documentation
- Help triage GitHub issues (label duplicates, confirm bugs)
- Share examples, tutorials, or blog posts about your usage

See the [Contributing Guide](/docs/help/contributing/) for how to get started.
