The people behind Updatecli are Open-Source veterans working on many different projects.

We build Updatecli to make our work easier by automating processes that would be daunting and error prone to do manually.
This allows us to better focus on the important parts of our day-to-day work.

If you are looking for consulting services or need us to implement a specific feature, feel free to reach out via email at [contact@updatecli.io](mailto:contact@updatecli.io)
