Updatecli requires a configuration file which defines the update strategy. A strategy can be seen as the definition of a full pipeline where we define the "what", the "when", and the "where" of our update strategy.

**What**

The "what" is named "source" and define what information we need, like an application release name, a docker image tag, etc.

**When**

The "when" is named "conditions", conditions are list things which must pass in order to proceed

**Where**

The "where" is named "target" and defines where we want to update an information like a a value from Dockerfile or a YAML. 


== Files

Updatecli reads one update strategy, aka pipeline, per file. The pipeline is split in three stages "source", "conditions", "targets", every stage use a resource that shape the pipeline and not every resource can be used in every situation.

! Please verify your need according resource documentation

A configuration accepts different type of file.

=== YAML

**Accepted extensions:** [".yaml",".yml"]

A YAML configuration can be specified using `--config <yaml_file>`, it accepts either a single file or a directory, if a directory is specified, then it runs recursively on every file inside the directory.

! Remark it's a very bad practice to put credentials in a YAML file.

.strategy.yaml
```
source:
  name: Get release version from
  kind: <resourceKind>
  spec:
    <resourceSpec>>
conditions:
  conditionID:
    name: Test if version exist
    kind: <resourceType>
    spec: 
      <resourceTypeSpec>
targets:  
  targetID:
    name: Update version in target1
    kind: <resourceType>
    spec:
      <resourceTypeSpec>
```

=== Go Templates

**Accepted extensions**: [".tpl",".tmpl"]

A go template configuration can be specified using `--config <go_template_file>` and `--values <yaml_file>`, it accepts either a single file or a directory, if a directory is specified, then it runs recursively on every go templates (or yaml file) inside the directory.

Using go templates allow us to specify generic values in a different YAML file, using `--values`, then reference those values from each go templates.
Updatecli also provides a custom function called `requireEnv` to inject any environment variable in the template example, `{{ requiredEnv "PATH" }}`.

More information on Go templates can be found https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[here]

.example.values.yaml
```
token: XXX
```

.example.strategy.yaml
```
source:
  name: Get release version from
  kind: githubRelease
  spec:
    owner: "updatecli"
    repository: "updatecli"
    token: "{{ .github.token }}" 
    username: "olblak"
    version: "latest"

conditions:
  conditionID:
    name: Test if version exist
    kind: <resourceType>
    spec: 
      <resourceTypeSpec>
targets:  
  targetID:
    name: Update version in target1
    kind: <resourceType>
    spec:
      <resourceTypeSpec>
```
