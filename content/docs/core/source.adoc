== Description

The "source" stage retrieve an information from a third "resource" like a file, an api and then inject that information in later stages.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
| kind | &#10004; |-| Define the resource type used for the `spec`
| name | &#10004; |-| Small description used in message, reports, etc.
| scm |-|-| Define source control management parameters, cfr to the scm
| spec | &#10004; |-| Define resource parameters, cfr to appropriated resource documentation
|===

== Example

.updatecli.yaml
```
sources:
  latestVersion:
    name: Get latest Venom release
    kind: githubRelease
    spec:
      owner: ovh
      repository: venom
      # Value from environment variable '$UPDATECLI_GITHUB_TOKEN'
      token: '{{ requiredEnv "UPDATECLI_GITHUB_TOKEN" }}'
      # Value from environment variable '$UPDATECLI_GITHUB_ACTOR'
      username: '{{ requiredEnv "UPDATECLI_GITHUB_ACTOR" }}'
      versioning:
        kind: semver
    transformers:
      - addPrefix: "v"
```

In this example we are looking for the latest release tag from https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins which is 'jenkins-2.75'. Unfortunately it contains the prefix "jenkins" which is useless for later stages, so we replace 'jenkins-' by nothing so the output of the source becomes "jenkins/jenkins:2.275-jdk" which is a valid docker image that can now be used in the later stages.
