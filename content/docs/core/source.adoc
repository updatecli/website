== Example

.updatecli.yaml
```
source:
  name: "Retrieve latest jenkins weekly version"
  kind: githubRelease
  prefix: "jenkins/jenkins:"
  postfix: "-jdk11"
  replaces:
    - from: "jenkins-"
      to: ""
  spec:
    owner: "jenkinsci"
    repository: "jenkins"
    token: "{{ requiredEnv .github.token }}" 
    username: "{{ .github.username }}" 
    version: "latest"

## To be continued
```

In this example we are looking for the latest release tag from https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins which is 'jenkins-2.75'. Unfortunately it contains the prefix "jenkins" which is useless for later stages, so we replace 'jenkins-' by nothing so the output of the source becomes "jenkins/jenkins:2.275-jdk" which is a valid docker image that can now be used in the later stages.
