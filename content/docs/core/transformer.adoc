== Description

The parameter "transformers" can be used by any stage definitions as "source", "condition", or "target".
A "transformers" contains a list of transformer. Each kind transformer rule apply a string manipulation like adding or removing characters.
Depending on the stage, a "transformers" block achieves different objectives.

**source**

Source returns information modified by a list of transformers

**condition**

A condition receives information from the source then modifies that value using transformers before using it in the resource.

**target**

A target receives information from the source then modifies that value with the transformers rule before using the resource.

== Parameters

|===
| Name | Default |Description
| replacer |-| Replace a string with another one, more link:#_replacer[here]
| replacers |-| A list of Replacer
| addPrefix |-| Add prefix to the value
| addSuffix |-| Add suffix to the value
| trimPrefix |-| Remove prefix to the value
| trimSuffix |-| Remove suffix to the value
| find |-| Search for a string value using regular expression and then return its value exist
| findSubMatch |-| Search for a substring using regular expression and then return its content, more link:#_FindSubMatch[here]
| semverInc| - | Bump semantic version, accept a comma separated list of ["major","minor","patch"]

=== Replacer

A replacer rule modifies the information by replacing the "from" value by the "to" value.

[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
| from | &#10004;|-| "from" value defines the string that will be replaced
| to | &#10004;|-| "to" value defines the string that we want to have
|===



=== FindSubMatch


A findSubMatch rule captures the desired information by applying "pattern" as a regexp and using "captureIndex" value as the index for the capture to return (default 0).

[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
| pattern | &#10004;|-| "pattern" value defines the regular expression to apply
| captureIndex |-|-| "captureIndex" value defines the index of the capture to return. Note that the default value `0` returns all submatches, and individual submatch indexes start at `1`.
|===


== Example
The `findSubmatch` below will return the submatch captured with `(.*?)`:

.updatecli.yaml
```
sources:
  default:
    name: "Get latest jenkins weekly version"
    kind: jenkins
    transformers:
      - addPrefix: "alpha-"

      - replacers:
          - from: "-jdk15"
            to: "-jdk17"
      - findsubmatch:
          pattern: '"(.*?):(.*)'
          captureIndex: 1
      - semverInc: "major,minor"
      - find: "2.234.(.*)$"
    spec:
      release: weekly
