== Description

The parameter "transformers" can be used by any stage definitions as "source", "condition", or "target".
A "transformers" contains a list of transformer. Each kind transformer rule apply a string manipulation like adding or removing characters.
Depending on the stage, a "transformers" block achieves different objectives.

**source**

Source returns information modified by a list of transformers

**condition**

A condition receives information from the source then modifies that value using transformers before using it in the resource.

**target**

A target receives information from the source then modifies that value with the transformers rule before using the resource.

== Parameters

We also deprecated string manipulation like prefix/postfix/replacer defined outside a transformers definition
