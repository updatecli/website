== Description

**source**

The `aws/ami` "source" retrieves the latest AWS AMI ID for specific filters.

**condition**

The `aws/ami` "condition" test that an AWS AMI exist based on specific filters.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
| accessKey | | - | One of the authentication methods to specify AWS access key xref:_authentication[here].
| secretKey | | - | One of the authentication methods to specify the secret key.
| region | | us-east-1 | Define AWS region to use.
| filters | &#10004; | - | Define a list of AMI filters, more information on the Filters section xref:_name[here].
| endpoint | | ec2.<region>.amazonaws.com | Define API endpoint.
| sortBy | | | Override default sorting, more information on xref:_sortby[sortBy]
|===

=== SortBy

Considering that the AMI resource is designed to manipulate the latest AMI found based on filters, the parameter `SortBy` can be used to specify how the list of results is sorted which affects the latest element returned.

`sortBy` accept one of the following `creationDateAsc` and `creationDateDesc` where they will respectively return the newest or the oldest AMI ID based on creation time.

=== Filter

AMI are identified based on different filter such platform, name,etc.

|===
| Name | Required | Default |Description
[cols="1,1,1,4",options=header]
| Name | &#10004; | - | Define the filter xref:_name[Name].
| Values | &#10004; | - | Define the filter value associated to the filter name.

=== Name

* architecture - The image architecture (i386 | x86_64 | arm64).

* block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination - A Boolean value that indicates
whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

* block-device-mapping.device-name - The device name specified in the
block device mapping (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh).

* block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for the
EBS volume.

* block-device-mapping.volume-size - The volume size of the EBS volume,
in GiB.

* block-device-mapping.volume-type - The volume type of the EBS volume
(gp2 | io1 | io2 | st1 | sc1 | standard).

* block-device-mapping.encrypted - A Boolean that indicates whether the
EBS volume is encrypted.

* description - The description of the image (provided during image creation).

* ena-support - A Boolean that indicates whether enhanced networking with
ENA is enabled.

* hypervisor - The hypervisor type (ovm | xen).

* image-id - The ID of the image.

* image-type - The image type (machine | kernel | ramdisk).

* is-public - A Boolean that indicates whether the image is public.

* kernel-id - The kernel ID.

* manifest-location - The location of the image manifest.

* name - The name of the AMI (provided during image creation).

* owner-alias - The owner alias (amazon | aws-marketplace). The valid
aliases are defined in an Amazon-maintained list. This is not the AWS
account alias that can be set using the IAM console. We recommend that
you use the Owner request parameter instead of this filter.

* owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use
the Owner request parameter instead of this filter.

* platform - The platform. To only list Windows-based AMIs, use windows.

* product-code - The product code.

* product-code.type - The type of the product code (devpay | marketplace).

* ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.

* root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example,
/dev/sda1).

* root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store).

* state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed).

* state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.

* state-reason-message - The message for the state change.

* sriov-net-support - A value of simple indicates that enhanced networking
with the Intel 82599 VF interface is enabled.

* tag:<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value.
For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner
and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for
the filter value.

* tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter
to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of
the tag value.

* virtualization-type - The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm).

== Authentication

Different mechanisms can be used to authenticate with AWS API. They are applied in the following order.

. xref:_environment_variables[Environment Variables]
. xref:_shared_credentials_file[Shared Credentials Files]
. xref:_updatecli_configuration[Updatecli configuration]

=== Environment Variables

updatecli retrieves credentials from the environment variables.

Environment variables used:

* Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
* Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`

=== Shared Credentials File

updatecli can retrieves credentials from the AWS cli credential file.
By default, it looks for the file location into `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` env variable, otherwise it fall back to the current user's home directory.

* Linux/OSX: "$HOME/.aws/credentials"
* Windows:   "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"

The AWS "profile" used is defined by the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE` and fallback to "default" if not defined.

=== Updatecli configuration

We can provide credentials directly from a updatecli configuration by using the two following settings `access_key` and `secret_key` as in the following example.

.updatecli configuration
```
kind: aws/ami
name: resource to manipulate aws ami id
spec:
  access_key: "insert AWS access key"
  secret_key: "insert AWS secret key"
  filters:
    - name: "name"
      values: "image name "
```

=== IAM Policy

To work, we need at least the following IAM policy

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:ReadTags",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

```
