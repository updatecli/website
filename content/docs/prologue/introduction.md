Updatecli is a tool uses to define and apply file update strategies.
It reads a yaml or a go template configuration file, then works into three stages:

1. Source: Based on a rule fetch a value from a third location that will be injected into later stages.
2. Conditions: Ensure that conditions are met based on the value retrieved during the source stage.
3. Target: Update and publish the target files based on a value retrieved from the source stage.

## Why?

Deciding how, when, where to update information is hard.

Nowadays they are countless tools that can apply continuous delivery or continuous deployment. 
To configure our infrastructure, we write ansible playbooks, puppet manifest, helm chart, etc. We heavily rely 
on configuration files to specify the version we need to install. But too often those files are manually updated. 

Because it's hard to automatically detect what information must be updated and when.

The logic that manipulates information from a configuration file is defined outside that configuration file. Information comes from different sources like maven, docker, files, git repository, etc.
Before modifying information, we probably want to validate some assumptions.

Updatecli allows combining blocks, aka plugins, to specify what information needs to be updated, when, and where. So we easily implement the workflow that suits our needs.
