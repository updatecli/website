Updatecli is a command-line tool used to define and apply update strategies.
It reads a manifest then works into three stages:

1. **Source**, which describes where a piece of information is coming from.
2. **Target**, which describes what we want to update based on a *source* output.
3. **Condition**, which defined a condition required to update the target.

## Why?

Deciding **how**, **when**, **where** to update information is hard.

Nowadays they are countless tools that can apply continuous delivery or continuous deployment. 
To configure our infrastructure, we write ansible playbooks, puppet manifest, helm chart, etc. We heavily rely 
on configuration files to specify the version we need to install. Unfortunately too often those files are manually updated. 

Because it's hard to automatically detect what information must be updated and when.

The logic that manipulates information from a configuration file is defined outside that configuration file. Information comes from different sources like maven, docker, files, git repository, etc.
Before modifying information, we probably want to validate some assumptions.

Updatecli allows combining blocks, aka plugins, to specify what information needs to be updated, when, and where. So we easily implement the workflow that suits our needs.
