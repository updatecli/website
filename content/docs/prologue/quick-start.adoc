Updatecli is a command-line tool used to update your file. You specify in manifest how you expect your files to be updated and then you run updatecli to enforce the result.

For this quickstart we are going to need three components:

. Updatecli binary installed.
. The data file to update is provided in this guide.
. The updatecli manifest is also provided in this guide.

== Installation

Updatecli is a standalone binary available on link:https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/releases/latest[GitHub] with packages for Windows, Linux, and OSX.

If you don't have it yet locally, please make sure you downloaded the latest updatecli as explained on link:{{< ref "installation/#_packages" >}}[Installation →]

== Scenario

Let's see what a simple updatecli pipeline can look like.

=== Data file

Firstly, we need a sample data file that we want to update (if needed).
It could be your puppet hieradata file, your helm value file, or whatever data file you need.
For us, it's a YAML file defining the "latest" Jenkins Docker image tag running in our infrastructure.

[source,yaml]
----
# data.yaml
{{<include "assets/code_example/doc/prologue/quickstart/data.yaml">}}
----

=== Updatecli Pipeline

Updatecli needs at least one manifest to know what update pipeline to apply.

In our manifest, we introduce the most three important concepts of an updatecli manifest.

. A **Source** definition describes where a piece of information is coming from. In the current example, we are looking for the latest Jenkins weekly version.
. A **Target** definition describes what we want to update based on a *source* output. In our example, we want to update the key "container.tag" in the file "data.yaml" to the version retrieved from the source so the latest Jenkins weekly version.
. A **Condition** definition defined conditions required to update the target. In our example, we want to test that the docker image "jenkinsci/jenkins:<latest Jenkins weekly version>" exists on DockerHub.

# manifest.yaml
{{<include "assets/code_example/doc/prologue/quickstart/updatecli.yaml">}}

Source, Condition, Target will behave differently based on the plugin used which is defined by the key "kind".

=== Updatecli Execution

Now that we have a data file and an updatecli manifest, describing how to update our file, let's see how to use updatecli.

So for doing so, please execute the following command:

1. To see what would change: `updatecli diff --config manifest.yaml`
2. To apply the change: `updatecli apply --config manifest.yaml`
3. To see that nothing needs to be changed anymore: `updatecli apply --config manifest.yaml`

== Conclusion

Through this example, we saw how updatecli works with a very simple pipeline. They are many improvements possible for this pipeline, such as automatically publishing updated files to a git repository, using the GitHub pull-request workflow, transforming the source value, not retrieving the latest version, etc.

The real power of updatecli is to combine different plugins to easily implement a customized update pipeline.
