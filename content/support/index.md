The people behind Updatecli are Open-Source veterans working on many different projects such as Jenkins.

We build Updatecli to make our work easier by automating processes that could be daunting to do manually. This allows us to focus on what matters in our day-to-day work.

Rather you are looking for consulting services or need us to implement a specific feature, feel free to drop us an email at [contact@updatecli.io](mailto:contact@updatecli.io)
